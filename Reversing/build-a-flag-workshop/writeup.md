The intended solution is roughly:
1. Find the list of base flags and mechanisms for selecting them.
2. Recognize the unused check_flag function that is not accessible from the CLI menu.
3. Reverse the check_flag function to identify the base flag to select and signature to input.
4. Put your flag together and submit
