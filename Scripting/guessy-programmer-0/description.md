Adventurer beware!

This challenge is not for the faint of heart.

Scour through the text. Find its innate meaning.

Find the red flags.

Find what you search for.

## PS
Regular expressions are the weapon of a true programmer. Not as clumsy or random as a search engine; an elegant tool from a more civilized age.
