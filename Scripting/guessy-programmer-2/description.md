Adventurer beware!

This challenge is not for the faint of heart.

Scour through history, through time, through place.

Wait it's not working this time.

No fair, this is a scripting challenge? How is making this be forensics fair?

Wait you say forensics is part of adventures? How? Why?

Automated forensics???

WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO ME???

## PS
It's over, Anakin. I have the high regex.

- `([Oo][Bb][Ii])-+([Ww][Aa][Nn]) ?(K[Ee][Nn][Oo][Bb][iI])+==`
