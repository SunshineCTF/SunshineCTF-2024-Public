One thing that we can notice off the bat from the game is that it is uncopylocked. This means that any user is able to download the game from ROBLOX. Downloading an uncopylocked game from the context menu that ROBLOX provides will always download the latest version of the game.

> Luckily, we've checked and they've uploaded the wrong one!

This line in the description is intended to hint at the fact that there is different versions of the game, and that this is the wrong version of the game that gets downloaded. Doing some research, you can find out that there is a way to download old versions of ROBLOX games as long as they are uncopylocked.

Solve:
Download `https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset/?id=102169837739752&version=2`
Modify the download file to append `.rbxl`
Open the game and read the `generateFlag` script within `ServerScriptStorage`
