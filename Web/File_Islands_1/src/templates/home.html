        <h1>Welcome to the Lost Caves of File Island!</h1>
        <p>You've arrived at the entrance of File Island, a mysterious place rumored to hide ancient secrets deep within its caverns. Your journey begins here, but beware—the paths are treacherous, and not all roads lead to treasure. Some may lead to...nothing at all.</p>

        <h2>Your first task:</h2>
        <p>Find the hidden path that doesn't exist! Sounds easy, right? But this is File Island—things aren't always what they seem. Try venturing down a path that feels unfamiliar, one that you haven't explored before.</p>

        <h3>Hint:</h3>
        <p>If you hit a dead end and find yourself staring at the mysterious <strong>404</strong> path, don't despair! Take a closer look at the <u>path</u> you ended up with—it might hold clues to the next step in your adventure.</p>

        <p><strong>Remember:</strong><br>
        Only the brave and clever will find their way through the Lost Caves and may find themselves in caves with <b>other paths</b> too!</p>
