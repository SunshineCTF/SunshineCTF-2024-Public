        <h1>404 - Dead End!</h1>
        <p>Oh no! It looks like you've ventured down a path that leads to nowhere. The <strong>secret_map</strong> you found has guided you to a dead end, and there's no treasure hereâ€”only silence and shadows.</p>

        <p>But don't give up just yet, brave explorer! File Island is full of hidden passages and secret trails. Somewhere, there's a path that will lead you closer to the truth.</p>

        <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Retrace your steps and look for clues in the places you've already explored. Sometimes, the key to moving forward is hidden where you've already been.</p>

        <p>Good luck, and remember: only those with sharp eyes and clever minds will conquer the Lost Caves!</p>

        <p>Your Treasure: <p style="color: green;"></style>{{ message }}</p></p>
