# Welcome to the Jungle

Welcome to the Jungle, brave explorer! You've found yourself in the depths of a
treacherous wilderness, armed with little more than a knapsack of questionable
supplies and your wits. Somewhere out there, a sly *genie* holds the key to
knowledge that could help you escape... if you can charm it right. But beware:
this jungle's full of pitfalls, lurking tigers, and hidden mysteries. Only those
with a keen eye for detail (and maybe a knack for bending reality a bit) will
make it out with the flag. Can you navigate the *heap* of pitfalls, uncover
secrets, and outsmart the genie? Remember, fortune favors the boldâ€”and sometimes
the lucky!
